**Idea**: <b>Live Companion for Agents aka <i>"Drishyam"</i></b> 


**Description**: <p> Within the KYC process, more than 70% of users rely on Agents for assistance in completing their onboarding. While KYC involves sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and OTP sharing, some users are hesitant to share this data with the Agents when seeking assistance over a call. Instead, these users prefer to handle the process themselves through the app while the Agent guides them through the steps. In this scenario, Agents remain unaware of the user's interactions with the app and often have to address numerous incorrect user actions. This not only consumes their engagement time but also has a direct impact on their performance and the overall conversion rate. </p>

<p> Introducing "DRISHYAM" our Live Companion for Agents to help Customers better and in real time. "Drishyam" will equip agents with a live, real-time view of user interactions within the app while assisting users.
This will reduce unnecessary interactions between agents and users, freeing up valuable time for agents to assist other users in need. It's a WIN-WIN for Angel, Agents and Customer. 
</p>

<p> While the concept is currently envisioned for KYC Support Agents, it has the potential for scalability to Customer Support with guidance from the top experts in Tech and Product</p>
